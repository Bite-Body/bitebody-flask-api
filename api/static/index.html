        Hello, welcome to api.bitebody.xyz! \nThe following below are our endpoints...

      <h2>
        <ul type="1">
            <li>User</li>
            <li>Meal</li>
            <li>Workout</li>
            <li>Collaborator</li>
          </ul>  

      </h2>

      <ol type="1">
          <p>Key entities listed above will all have the following functionality</p>
          <li>GET:
              <p> 
                   method is used to retreive data from a server at the specified 
                   resource(Meal,user,collaborator). 
             </p>
             <p>For example, say you have an API with a /users endpoint.
                 Making a GET request to that endpoint should return a list of all available users.</p>
          </li>
        <li>Post:

            <p> 
                Requests are used to send data to the API sever to create or udpate a resource. 
                The data sent to the server is stored in the request body of the HTTP request. 
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>Put:

            <p> 
                requests are used to send data to the API to create or update a resource. The difference is that PUT requests are idempotent.
                 That is, calling the same PUT request multiple times will always produce the same result.
                 In contrast, calling a POST request repeatedly make have side effects of creating the same resource 
                 multiple times. 
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>Delete:

            <p> 
                If a new user is created with a POST request to /users, and it can be retrieved with a GET request to /users/{{userid}}, 
                then making a DELETE request to /users/{{userid}} will completely remove that user.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
